# Sample snap-openstack configuration file
#
# snap-openstack will automatically substitute the following 
# in both paths for files and directories and in templates:
#
#  SNAP_COMMON -> snap_common
#  SNAP -> snap
#  SNAP -> snap_shared
#
# Setup is executed for all entry points prior to execution
# snap-openstack will assure that templated files are in place
# and that any directory structure in $SNAP_COMMON is created
setup:
  dirs:
    - "{snap_common}/etc/nova.conf.d"
    - "{snap_common}/etc/nova"
    - "{snap_common}/logs"
  templates:
    "nova-snap.conf.j2": "[snap_common}/etc/nova.conf.d/nova-snap.conf"
# Entry points are used to execute commands from with the snap
# with a sane set of defaults in terms of configuration files
# and directories
entry_points:
  # Executes the following:
  #
  # nova-manage --config-file=$SNAP/etc/nova/nova,conf \
  #             --config-file=$SNAP_COMMON/etc/nova/nova.conf \
  #             --config-dir=$SNAP_COMMON/etc/nova.conf.d \
  #             --log-file=$SNAP_COMMON/logs/nova-manage.log
  #
  # this is designed to be executed from the snapcraft.yaml apps section
  # using:
  #
  #  command: snap-openstack nova-manage
  # 
  # any additional arguments will be passed to the underlying binary
  nova-manage:
    binary: nova-manage
    config-files:
